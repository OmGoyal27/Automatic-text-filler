Hi. So this is a project where you could make an automatic filler for boring but long texts and you also don't want to copy something(For some reason) Then this project would be perfect for you!

This project was inspired when I wanted to use a CAD software but for some reason, I was not able to use the copy and paste command. I wanted to set a specific size for the objects and it took a long time without copy and paste.

So I decided to make this project. I would be glad if this helps you in any way or inspire you to create your own!
